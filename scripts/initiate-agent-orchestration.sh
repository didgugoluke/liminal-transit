# 🤖 Agent Progress Tracking

## Phase 1: Foundation Enhancement (Week 1)
- [ ] Advanced typography system with reading rhythm optimization
- [ ] Mobile-first responsive design with thumb-friendly interactions  
- [ ] Ambient animation system for story beat emphasis
- [ ] Comprehensive accessibility implementation (WCAG AAA)
- [ ] Performance optimization with code-splitting and caching

## Phase 2: Story Intelligence (Week 2)
- [ ] Persistent character system with AI-driven personality development
- [ ] Advanced choice mechanics beyond binary Y/N interactions
- [ ] World state persistence with cross-session story continuity
- [ ] Multi-AI orchestration for specialized narrative generation
- [ ] Story arc management with tension/resolution tracking

## Phase 3: Immersive Experience (Week 3)
- [ ] Ambient audio system with contextual soundscapes
- [ ] Advanced micro-interactions and atmospheric visual cues
- [ ] Reading rhythm optimization with adaptive text pacing
- [ ] Choice consequence visualization and preview system
- [ ] Adaptive narrative AI that learns from user behavior

## Phase 4: Technical Excellence (Week 4)
- [ ] Sophisticated state management with time-travel debugging
- [ ] Cloud sync and cross-device story continuation
- [ ] Comprehensive testing suite (unit, integration, E2E, accessibility)
- [ ] Developer experience tools for story content creation
- [ ] Performance monitoring and optimization systems

## Success Metrics Dashboard
- **User Engagement**: Baseline 2-3 min → Target 20-30 min sessions
- **Performance**: Baseline 5s load → Target <2s load times
- **Accessibility**: Baseline Basic → Target WCAG AAA compliance
- **Story Quality**: Baseline RNG → Target AI-driven persistent worlds
- **Developer Experience**: Baseline Manual → Target 10x faster workflows

# Create agent communication protocol
cat > .agents/coordination/protocol.md << 'EOF'
# 🤖 Agent Communication Protocol

## Daily Coordination (Automated)
- **Morning Standup**: Progress report, dependency coordination, blocker identification
- **Afternoon Sync**: Quality check, integration testing, user feedback review
- **Evening Summary**: Progress metrics, next day planning, stakeholder updates

## Quality Gates (Automated)
- **Code Quality**: TypeScript strict, ESLint compliance, test coverage >95%
- **Performance**: Load time <2s, interaction response <100ms, bundle size optimized
- **Accessibility**: WCAG AAA compliance, screen reader testing, keyboard navigation
- **User Experience**: Mobile-first design, cross-device compatibility, offline capability

## Conflict Resolution (Automated)
1. **Automated Merge**: Standard dependency resolution with shared component coordination
2. **Peer Review**: Agent cross-validation for complex integration points
3. **Escalation Protocol**: Human strategic oversight for architectural decisions only
4. **Rollback Strategy**: Automated revert with explanation for failed implementations

## Success Metrics (Real-time)
- **Implementation Velocity**: Features completed per day with quality validation
- **User Impact**: Session duration, completion rates, satisfaction scores
- **Technical Excellence**: Performance metrics, test coverage, accessibility scores
- **Coordination Efficiency**: Agent collaboration success, blocker resolution time
