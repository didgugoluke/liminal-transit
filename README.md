## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ or Docker
- Package manager: pnpm (recommended) or npm

### Quick Start

1. **Clone and Setup**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd story-time
   pnpm install
   ```

2. **Development Mode**
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```
   Opens http://localhost:5173

3. **Using Docker** (Recommended)
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -dev
   ```

### First Run Experience

1. **Immediate Start**: Story begins automatically in a liminal space
2. **Dynamic Generation**: AI creates unique opening scenario
3. **Instant Engagement**: No setup barriers, immediate narrative immersion

### AI Integration Setup

The application uses embedded AI capabilities for narrative generation. No external API configuration required—stories generate automatically through integrated language model services.

## Gameplay Guide

### Basic Controls
- **Yes/No Buttons**: Make story choices
- **Seed Input**: Enter custom world seeds for consistent starting points
- **New World**: Generate fresh story with current or new seed
- **Story Progress**: Track narrative development

### Understanding Seeds
Seeds are text strings that generate consistent story starting points:
- `midnight-station` → Always generates the same initial scenario
- `forest-path-7` → Different opening with forest-themed elements
- Leave empty for random generation each time

### Story Structure
Stories begin in transitional spaces and evolve based on choices:
- Initial situation establishes stakes and atmosphere
- Binary choices create branching narrative paths
- Consequences ripple through subsequent story beats
- Natural conclusions provide satisfying closure
