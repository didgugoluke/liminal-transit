# ðŸ¤– Agent Communication Protocol

## Daily Coordination (Automated)
- **Morning Standup**: Progress report, dependency coordination, blocker identification
- **Afternoon Sync**: Quality check, integration testing, user feedback review
- **Evening Summary**: Progress metrics, next day planning, stakeholder updates

## Quality Gates (Automated)
- **Code Quality**: TypeScript strict, ESLint compliance, test coverage >95%
- **Performance**: Load time <2s, interaction response <100ms, bundle size optimized
- **Accessibility**: WCAG AAA compliance, screen reader testing, keyboard navigation
- **User Experience**: Mobile-first design, cross-device compatibility, offline capability

## Conflict Resolution (Automated)
1. **Automated Merge**: Standard dependency resolution with shared component coordination
2. **Peer Review**: Agent cross-validation for complex integration points
3. **Escalation Protocol**: Human strategic oversight for architectural decisions only
4. **Rollback Strategy**: Automated revert with explanation for failed implementations

## Success Metrics (Real-time)
- **Implementation Velocity**: Features completed per day with quality validation
- **User Impact**: Session duration, completion rates, satisfaction scores
- **Technical Excellence**: Performance metrics, test coverage, accessibility scores
- **Coordination Efficiency**: Agent collaboration success, blocker resolution time
