## ðŸ”¥ **The Fuse is Lit**

This milestone marks the transition from **human strategic planning** to **autonomous AI execution**. Everything beyond this point will be driven by AI agents following the comprehensive architecture and epics we've established.

### ðŸ¤– **AI Agents Ready for Activation**

**Epic 1 Team**:
- **CodeGen Agent**: Vite + React + TypeScript implementation
- **DataGov Agent**: Data model integration and management  
- **StoryGen Agent**: Narrative generation interface

**Supporting Agents**:
- **Observatory Agent**: Real-time monitoring and coordination
- **SecurityAgent**: Continuous security validation
- **TelemetryTracker**: AI interaction logging and optimization

## ðŸŽ¯ **Next Phase: Autonomous Code Generation**

From this point forward:
1. **AI agents execute Epic 1** - Core Platform Foundation
2. **HITM oversight** through GitHub Projects and Observatory
3. **Autonomous progression** through Epic 2 (AI Integration) and Epic 3 (Infrastructure)
4. **Self-optimizing platform** with continuous AI improvement
