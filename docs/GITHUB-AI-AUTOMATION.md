  validationCriteria: string[]; // Success requirements
  rollbackProcedure: string; // Failure recovery process
}

// Production Example: Epic Breakdown → Scrum Master → Development
const epicToImplementation: AgentHandoff[] = [
  {
    triggerAgent: "Epic Breakdown Agent",
    targetAgent: "Scrum Master Agent",
    handoffTrigger: "move this story from No Status to To Do",
    validationCriteria: ["Story validated", "Project status updated"],
    rollbackProcedure: "Reset story to No Status, notify human oversight",
  },
  {
    triggerAgent: "Scrum Master Agent",
    targetAgent: "Development Agent",
    handoffTrigger: "Development Agent - implement this story",
    validationCriteria: [
      "Branch created",
