### Self-Documenting Story Lifecycle
```typescript
interface StoryLifecycleManager {
  creation: {
    generateFromEpic: (epic: Epic) => UserStory[];
    createAcceptanceCriteria: (story: UserStory) => AcceptanceCriteria[];
    establishDefinitionOfDone: (criteria: AcceptanceCriteria[]) => DoD;
    linkDependencies: (story: UserStory) => Dependency[];
  };
  
  implementation: {
    trackCommits: (story: UserStory) => CommitHistory[];
    linkPullRequests: (story: UserStory) => PullRequest[];
    monitorProgress: (story: UserStory) => ProgressMetrics;
    validateCompletion: (story: UserStory) => ValidationResult;
  };
  
  documentation: {
    generateImplementationDocs: (story: UserStory) => Documentation;
    createTestDocumentation: (story: UserStory) => TestDocs;
    updateUserGuides: (story: UserStory) => UserGuideUpdate[];
    maintainTraceability: (story: UserStory) => TraceabilityMatrix;
  };
  
  analytics: {
    trackVelocity: (stories: UserStory[]) => VelocityMetrics;
    measureComplexity: (story: UserStory) => ComplexityScore;
    analyzeBlockers: (story: UserStory) => BlockerAnalysis;
    predictCompletion: (stories: UserStory[]) => CompletionForecast;
  };
}
```

### Cross-Epic Coordination System
```yaml
Epic Dependency Management:
  DependencyTypes:
    - Technical: Shared components or infrastructure
    - Business: Sequential business value delivery
    - Resource: Team member or skill dependencies
    - Data: Shared data models or APIs
    
  AutomatedTracking:
    - Dependency graph visualization
    - Critical path analysis
    - Resource conflict detection
    - Risk assessment and mitigation
    
  CoordinationWorkflows:
    - Cross-epic planning sessions
    - Dependency resolution automation
    - Stakeholder impact communication
    - Timeline adjustment notifications
    
Stakeholder Communication:
  AutomatedReporting:
    - Daily progress summaries
    - Weekly velocity reports
    - Monthly milestone updates
    - Quarterly business impact analysis
    
  NotificationTriggers:
    - Epic completion milestones
    - Critical dependency blockers
    - Timeline adjustments
    - Quality gate failures
    
  CustomizableDelivery:
    - Executive dashboards
    - Technical team updates
    - Business stakeholder reports
    - Customer-facing communications
```

This comprehensive epic and story management system ensures that all work is automatically documented, tracked, and reported while maintaining complete traceability from business objectives to implementation details.
