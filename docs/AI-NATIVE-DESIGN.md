This AI Native design transforms software development from a primarily human activity to an AI-orchestrated process where humans provide strategic direction while AI agents handle implementation, optimization, and management. The result is dramatically faster development cycles, higher code quality, and the ability to focus on creative and strategic work rather than technical implementation details.
