## 📁 Documentation Organization Complete

### **✅ Working Documents Moved**

Created `docs/working/` folder and moved:
- ✅ `kanban-status-bug-notes.md` (bug investigation)
- ✅ `BUG-FIX-SUCCESS-REPORT.md` (implementation success report)
- ✅ `WORKFLOW-SYNTAX-FIXES.md` (syntax error fixes)
- ✅ `BUG-FIX-IMPLEMENTATION.md` (technical implementation)
- ✅ `BOOTSTRAP-EVOLUTION-ANALYSIS.md` (development evolution)

### **📋 Root Directory Cleaned**

**Before:**
```
/story-time/

    ├── BOOTSTRAP-EVOLUTION-ANALYSIS.md ❌ Working file
    └── [core documentation]          ✅ Core docs
```

**After:**
```
/story-time/
├── README.md                         ✅ Core doc

    │   ├── kanban-status-bug-notes.md
    │   ├── BUG-FIX-SUCCESS-REPORT.md
    │   ├── WORKFLOW-SYNTAX-FIXES.md
    │   ├── BUG-FIX-IMPLEMENTATION.md
    │   └── BOOTSTRAP-EVOLUTION-ANALYSIS.md
    └── [core documentation]          ✅ Core docs
```
