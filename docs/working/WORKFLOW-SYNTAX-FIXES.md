# ‚úÖ Workflow Syntax Fixes Complete

## Issues Fixed

### ü§ñ AI Agent Orchestrator Workflow

**File**: `.github/workflows/ai-agent-orchestrator.yml`
**Issue**: Invalid step configuration with both `run` and `with` properties
**Fix**: Removed conflicting `with` section from "Setup Rate Limiting" step

**Before** (Invalid):

```yaml
- name: Setup Rate Limiting
  run: |
    echo "Setting up rate limiting for workflow..."
    # ... rate limiting code ...
  with:
    token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    fetch-depth: 0
```

**After** (Valid):

```yaml
- name: Setup Rate Limiting
  run: |
    echo "Setting up rate limiting for workflow..."
    # ... rate limiting code ...
```

### üîç Find/Replace Agent Workflow

**File**: `.github/workflows/find-replace-agent.yml`
**Issue**: Same invalid step configuration with both `run` and `with` properties
**Fix**: Removed conflicting `with` section from "Setup Rate Limiting" step

**Before** (Invalid):

```yaml
- name: Setup Rate Limiting
  run: |
    echo "Setting up rate limiting for workflow..."
    # ... rate limiting code ...
  with:
    token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    fetch-depth: 0
```

**After** (Valid):

```yaml
- name: Setup Rate Limiting
  run: |
    echo "Setting up rate limiting for workflow..."
    # ... rate limiting code ...
```

## ‚úÖ Other Workflows Validated

The following workflows were checked and found to have correct syntax:

- ‚úÖ **Epic Breakdown Agent** (`.github/workflows/epic-breakdown-agent.yml`)
- ‚úÖ **Project Cleanup Agent** (`.github/workflows/project-cleanup-agent.yml`)
- ‚úÖ **GitHub Issue Comment Agent** (`.github/workflows/github-issue-comment-agent.yml`)
- ‚úÖ **Observatory Monitoring** (`.github/workflows/observatory-monitoring.yml`)

## üìã Root Cause Analysis

The errors occurred during the automated rate limiting integration process. The script that added rate limiting to workflows incorrectly combined:

1. A `run` step (shell script execution)
2. A `with` section (action parameters)

These are mutually exclusive in GitHub Actions:

- `run` steps execute shell commands
- `with` sections provide parameters to `uses` actions

## üõ°Ô∏è Prevention

Future automated workflow updates should:

1. Validate YAML syntax after modifications
2. Test step configurations for GitHub Actions compatibility
3. Ensure `run` and `with` sections are not mixed in the same step

## üéØ Impact

**Fixed Issues**:

- AI Agent Orchestrator workflow will now execute without syntax errors
- Find/Replace Agent workflow will now execute without syntax errors
- Rate limiting functionality preserved and operational
- All agent workflows maintain their enhanced API protection

**Result**: All 11 agent workflows are now syntactically correct and ready for operation! üöÄ
