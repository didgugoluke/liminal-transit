  };
}
```

### VS Code Integration Workflows
```yaml
HITM Workflow Patterns:
  FeatureRequest:
    Trigger: Create GitHub Issue with 'feature-request' label
    Process:
      1. HITM describes feature in natural language
      2. AI analyzes requirements and existing codebase
      3. Agent generates implementation plan and estimates
      4. VS Code shows real-time progress in status bar
      5. Pull request auto-created with full implementation
      6. HITM reviews and approves/requests changes
      
  StoryCreation:
    Trigger: Create GitHub Issue with 'story-theme' label
    Process:
      1. HITM provides narrative theme and mood
      2. StoryGen agent creates story beats and dialogue
      3. VS Code preview shows story progression
      4. Real-time A/B testing of narrative variations
      5. Analytics show engagement predictions
      6. Auto-deploy to staging for live testing
      
  QualityControl:
    Trigger: Pull request creation or code change
    Process:
      1. QualityGuard agent analyzes code changes
      2. VS Code highlights potential issues inline
      3. Automated test generation and execution
      4. Security scanning and vulnerability analysis
      5. Performance impact assessment
      6. HITM receives summary and recommendations
      
  TechnicalDebtTracking:
    Trigger: Continuous code analysis
    Process:
      1. DebtTracker agent identifies technical debt
      2. VS Code annotations show debt hotspots
      3. Automated refactoring suggestions
      4. Impact analysis on development velocity
      5. Prioritized backlog of debt reduction tasks
      6. Progress tracking and debt reduction metrics
```
