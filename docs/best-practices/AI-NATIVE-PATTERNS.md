## Core AI Native Principles

### 1. **Human-in-the-Middle (HITM) Pattern**

```typescript
interface HITMPattern {
  human: {
    responsibilities: ["vision", "strategy", "themes", "approval"];
    interfaces: ["vscode", "observatory_dashboard", "mobile_review"];
    interaction_mode: "strategic_oversight";
  };

  ai_agents: {
    responsibilities: [
      "implementation",
      "testing",
      "deployment",
      "optimization",
    ];
    coordination: "autonomous_orchestration";
    human_escalation: "exception_only";
  };

  decision_flow: {
    strategic: "human_driven";
    tactical: "ai_driven";
    operational: "fully_automated";
  };
}
```

### 2. **Agent Orchestration Pattern**

```typescript
interface AgentOrchestration {
  meta_agent: {
    role: "supervisor";
    responsibilities: [
      "monitor_all_agents",
      "detect_infinite_loops",
      "coordinate_workflows",
      "quality_assurance",
    ];
    intervention_triggers: [
      "stuck_agents",
      "quality_degradation",
      "cost_overruns",
    ];
  };

  specialized_agents: {
    codegen: "feature_implementation";
    storygen: "narrative_generation";
    infraopt: "infrastructure_optimization";
    secureops: "security_monitoring";
    qualityguard: "quality_assurance";
  };

  communication: {
    protocol: "event_driven";
    coordination: "asynchronous";
    error_handling: "graceful_degradation";
  };
}
```

### 3. **Self-Optimizing Systems Pattern**

```typescript
interface SelfOptimizingSystem {
  continuous_monitoring: {
    performance_metrics: "real_time";
    cost_analysis: "automated";
    quality_scores: "ml_driven";
    user_engagement: "behavioral_tracking";
  };

## AI Native Architecture Patterns

### 1. **AI-First Component Design**

```typescript
// AI-generated component with self-optimization
interface AIFirstComponent<T> {
  // AI generates initial implementation
  generate: (requirements: Requirements) => Component<T>;

  // AI monitors and optimizes performance
  optimize: (metrics: PerformanceMetrics) => OptimizedComponent<T>;

  // AI handles error recovery
  self_heal: (error: Error) => RecoveryStrategy;

  // AI validates quality continuously
  quality_check: () => QualityReport;
}

// Example: AI-generated story component
const StoryComponent = createAIComponent({
  requirements: {
    narrative_generation: "dynamic",
    choice_handling: "binary_decisions",
    engagement_optimization: "real_time",
    accessibility: "wcag_2_1_aa",
  },

  ai_capabilities: {
    content_generation: true,
    quality_assurance: true,
    performance_monitoring: true,
    user_behavior_analysis: true,
  },

  self_optimization: {
    narrative_quality: "ml_scoring",
    engagement_metrics: "behavioral_analysis",
    performance_tuning: "automated",
    accessibility_compliance: "continuous_validation",
  },
});
```

### 2. **Event-Driven AI Coordination**

```typescript
interface AIEventSystem {
  event_types: {
    // Development events
    "feature.requested": FeatureRequest;
    "code.generated": CodeGeneration;
    "tests.completed": TestResults;
    "deployment.triggered": DeploymentEvent;

    // Quality events
    "quality.degraded": QualityAlert;
    "performance.issue": PerformanceAlert;
    "security.threat": SecurityEvent;

    // User events
    "story.completed": StoryCompletion;
    "choice.made": UserChoice;
    "engagement.tracked": EngagementMetrics;
  };

  agent_subscriptions: {
    meta_agent: ["*"]; // Subscribes to all events
    codegen_agent: ["feature.requested", "code.review"];
    storygen_agent: ["story.requested", "choice.made"];
    quality_agent: ["code.generated", "deployment.triggered"];
  };

  coordination_patterns: {
    sequential: "story_generation_pipeline";
    parallel: "code_quality_checks";
    conditional: "deployment_approval_gates";
    circuit_breaker: "failure_recovery";
  };
}
```

      narrative_coherence: "ai_scoring";
      engagement_potential: "ml_prediction";
      content_safety: "automated_moderation";
      accessibility: "automated_validation";
    };

    infrastructure: {
      well_architected: "six_pillar_compliance";
      security_hardening: "cis_benchmarks";
      cost_optimization: "automated_analysis";
      performance_benchmarks: "sla_validation";
    };
  };

  quality_enforcement: {
    blocking_issues: ["security_vulnerabilities", "accessibility_violations"];
    warning_issues: ["performance_degradation", "cost_increases"];
    automated_fixes: ["code_formatting", "dependency_updates"];
  };

  continuous_improvement: {
    quality_trend_analysis: "ml_driven";
