## 🔄 V2 Intelligence Integration Patterns

### GitHub Copilot + Claude 4 Fusion Architecture

```typescript
interface IntelligentAgent {
  // Natural Language Understanding (GitHub Copilot Chat)
  parseHumanIntent(input: string): Intent;

  // Deep Reasoning (Claude 4)
  analyzeContext(intent: Intent, history: Context[]): Strategy;

  // Rapid Execution (GPT-4)
  generateImplementation(strategy: Strategy): Implementation;

  // Continuous Learning
  learnFromOutcome(
    implementation: Implementation,
    result: Result
  ): LearningUpdate;
}

// Example: Story Intelligence Agent v2
class StoryIntelligenceAgentV2 implements IntelligentAgent {
  async processStory(storyText: string): Promise<TechnicalPlan> {
    // 1. GitHub Copilot understands natural language
    const intent = await this.parseHumanIntent(storyText);

    // 2. Claude 4 analyzes full context and creates strategy
    const strategy = await this.analyzeContext(intent, this.projectHistory);

    // 3. GPT-4 generates specific implementation plan
    const plan = await this.generateImplementation(strategy);

    // 4. Self-validation and optimization
    return this.optimizePlan(plan);
  }
}
```

### Adaptive Learning Framework

```yaml
Learning Cycle:
  1. Execute Task → Record outcome and performance metrics
  2. Analyze Success → Identify patterns that led to good outcomes
  3. Update Strategy → Adjust prompt engineering and decision logic
  4. Share Knowledge → Distribute learnings to other agents
  5. Validate Improvement → A/B test new strategies vs previous

Example Learning:
  - "Epic #45 took 3 days instead of 1" → Learns to better estimate complexity
  - "Users loved the UI from PR #67" → Learns successful design patterns
  - "Security fix in PR #78 broke tests" → Learns to predict integration issues
  - "Claude 4 generated better code than GPT-4 for React components" → Routes React tasks to Claude 4
```
