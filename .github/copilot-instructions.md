# NOVELI.SH — AI Native Interactive Storytelling Platform

### AI Native Development Principles

- **100% AI Orchestration** — GitHub Copilot agents manage entire development lifecycle
- **AWS Well-Architected Foundation** — All architecture decisions align with six pillars for enterprise compliance
- **Zero Human Overhead Management** — AI handles governance, compliance, security, and operational tasks
- **Autonomous Code Management** — Self-generating features, tests, and documentation
- **Zero Human Scaffolding** — AI handles bootstrapping, debugging, and maintenance
- **Self-Optimizing Architecture** — Real-time performance optimization and scaling
- **Human-in-the-Middle (HITM)** — Humans focus on strategy, vision, and creative direction
- **Continuous Learning Loop** — AI agents improve based on user feedback and metrics
- **Enterprise Compliance by Design** — Automated SOC 2, ISO 27001, GDPR, PCI DSS adherence

### Design Principles

- **Typography is the UI** — whitespace, rhythm, weight > chrome.
- **Restraint builds immersion** — 1–2 sentences max.
- **Conversation-first** — log like a chat, Yes/No as large buttons.
- **Whitespace as drama** — each line spaced with intent.
- **Ambient feel** — smooth auto-scroll, optional pulsing "…" while thinking.
- **Minimal palette** — light/dark themes, sparing highlights.
- **Inclusive by default** — diverse characters without fanfare.
- **Accessibility** — ARIA roles, keyboard/touch nav, screen reader support.
- **ZERO EMOJIS** — Use icon libraries exclusively, never emoji characters in any user-facing content, narrative, dialogue, or UI elements.

## Project Overview

AI Native interactive storytelling platform with **100% AI-driven development and content generation**. Features **autonomous GitHub Copilot orchestration**, self-optimizing architecture, and **zero human scaffolding**. Built on the **AWS Well-Architected Framework** for enterprise-grade compliance "by design" with automated governance, security, reliability, performance, cost optimization, and sustainability.

The platform begins in a **liminal transit space** (bus/train/queue) that launches completely AI-generated branching storylines. **No hardcoded story elements, business rules, or fallback systems**. All development tasks, from feature implementation to story generation, are handled by AI agents while humans focus on strategic direction.

### AI Native Capabilities

- **Autonomous Development**: GitHub Copilot Workspace handles feature implementation, testing, and deployment
- **Self-Generating Stories**: AI agents create narrative content from themes without human writing
- **Intelligent Orchestration**: Automated project management, bug fixes, and performance optimization
- **Continuous Learning**: AI agents improve based on user engagement and feedback metrics
- **Strategic Human Role**: HITM focuses on vision, themes, and high-value creative decisions
- **Enterprise Compliance**: Automated adherence to all regulatory frameworks with zero overhead

## Development Guidelines

- **AI-First Development**: All features begin with AI agent analysis and implementation
- **Agent Template**: Use `docs/AGENT-TEMPLATE-GOLD-STANDARD.md` for all new GitHub Actions agents
- **Code Quality**: strict TS, ESLint, Prettier, no `any`, comprehensive testing
- **Autonomous Testing**: AI-generated unit, integration, E2E, and accessibility tests
- **Self-Documenting**: AI-generated documentation, JSDoc, and architectural diagrams
- **Components**: functional, typed props, error boundaries, lazy load non-core
- **State Management**: hooks for local, Context for global, session storage, URL seeds
- **Performance**: AI-optimized bundle analysis, code-splitting, memoization
- **Security**: AI-monitored safe errors, automated dependency audits, zero hardcoded content
- **GitHub Integration**: Projects for story management, Actions for AI workflows, Discussions for collaboration
- **Infrastructure**: Terraform modules, GitHub Actions CI/CD, AWS native services
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch metrics, AI performance tracking, automated optimization
- **TERMINAL SAFETY**: NEVER end git commit messages, gh issue comments, or any shell commands with exclamation marks or special characters that break terminal execution. Always use periods or no punctuation.
- **CONTENT POLICY**: Zero emojis in all user-facing content, narrative text, UI labels, dialogue, or system messages. Use icon libraries for visual elements. Exception: developer logs and build scripts only.
